  <h1>SaitoHUD Reference  </h1>
  <p>SaitoHUD is a utility HUD with a wide variety of functions. Note that it does not attempt to protect itself from tampered global functions.</p>
  <h2>Filters</h2>
  <p>Some of SaitoHUD's commands support <em>filters</em>, which allow you to specify a criteria by which to match entities. You list a set of conditions separated by spaces, with each condition being in the format of <code>property=value</code>. For an entity to match a filter, all conditions must be satisfied. For example, if you wanted to only select entities with &quot;wire&quot; in their class name and &quot;gate&quot; in the model paths, the following filter would be used:</p>
  <pre>class=wire model=gate</pre>
  <p>Note how they match <em>substrings</em>. By default, it is assumed that you mean class, so the following filter would have sufficed:</p>
  <pre>wire model=gate</pre>
  <p>If you want to a condition that the entity must <em>not</em> match, place a hyphen (-) in front of the value. For example, if you wanted to match conditions mentioned above, but you did not want to match entities with &quot;sand&quot; in their material paths, you would use:</p>
  <pre>class=wire model=gate material=-sand</pre>
  <p>An alternative syntax of the above filter using the syntax <code>@type pattern</code> is:</p>
<pre>wire @model gate @material sand</pre>
  <p>SaitoHUD supports the following  properties to filter by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>@id</li>
    <li>@mindist (alias: @min)</li>
    <li>@maxdist (alias: @max)</li>
    <li>@model (alias: @mdl)</li>
    <li>@material (alias @mat)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The @mindist and @maxdist properties take numbers as arguments and allow you to filter entities by their distance away from you.</p>
  <p>Use an asterisk (*) if you wish to match all class names, models, or materials (ex. <code>*</code> or <code>@mdl *</code> or even <code>@mdl -*</code>). Note that it cannot be used as a wildcard character; if you use it, it must stand alone. To disable a filter, execute the command without any arguments.</p>
  <p>If you want at least one condition to match, but you do need all conditions to match, you can use OR. ORs have operator precedence over ANDs. So far, you have not seen AND explicitly written because it is assumed, but you are free to write it. See the filters below, which all do the same thing:</p>
  <pre>wire and (expr or gate mdl=cpu) or mdl=barrel<br>wire and (expr or gate @mdl cpu) or @mdl barrel<br>wire ( expr or gate @mdl cpu ) or @mdl barrel</pre>
  <h2>List Gestures</h2>
  <p>SaitoHUD provides a quick list menu that can be accessed with a key and quickly scrolled with the mouse. By default, SaitoHUD does not have anything in this menu, but plugins may populate the list. To enable list gestures, bind <code>+listgest</code> to a key or mouse button, preferrably a mouse button.</p>
<h2>Overlays</h2>
<p>The overlays module has functions to display the locations of other players and highlight entities using filters. </p>

  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Commands</h3>
<p>These commands are very useful for finding &quot;lost&quot; entities. The results of the filtering operations are cached for very brief amounts of time to significantly increase performance.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Sampling</h2>
<p>Sampling allows you to trace the path of an entity or player. The path that the entity or player travels is drawn on the screen. By default, you can only sample one entity at a time, but a cvar adjusts this behavior.</p>

<h2>Stranded Game Mode</h2>
<p>SaitoHUD has the following features for the <em>Stranded</em> game mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replaces the resource drawing code with a routine that also colors the name of resources appropriate colors (stone is a grey-ish color).</li>
  <li>Adds a very useful context-sensitive list gesture menu.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Cvars</h3>

    <td>bool</td>

  <tr>
    <td>stranded_res_distance</td>
    <td>float</td>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>The maximum distance away a resource can be for its resource name will be displayed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Sandbox Game Mode</h2>
<p>For sandbox game modes (and all game modes that not stranded), there is a default sandbox list gesture menu that contains some common tools. To customize this list, create a CSV file at <strong>data/saitohud/sandbox/menu.csv</strong> (in your data/ folder) and make a list of the tools that you wish to have on the menu. The first column is the text that will be shown, while the second column is the console command to run.</p>
<p>The following is a sample from the default menu.csv file:</p>
<pre>Title,Command
Easy Precision Tool,tool_easy_precision
Weld Tool,tool_weld
Remover Tool,tool_remover
No Collide Tool,tool_nocollide
Adv. Duplicator Tool,tool_adv_duplicator
Expression 2 Tool,tool_wire_expression2
Wire Debugger Tool,tool_wire_debugger
Improved Wire Tool,tool_wire_improved</pre>
