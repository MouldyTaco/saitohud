Introduction
------------

Features:
- Information about the entity that you are looking at
  - Dump the information to the console so you can copy text
- Name tags on all players, with their distance away
- Overlays over entities:
  - Class names
  - Bounding box
  - 3D origin marker
  - Overlays can be applied selectively to only entities you want
- Position tracking/sampling

SaitoHUD was something I made personally for myself to help me, and so it
lacks a GUI and has to be controlled solely from console. It is also not
fully customizable.
